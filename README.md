# MatrixMath

C# tool to perform mathematic operations on matrices. So far, supports addition, subtraction and multiplication.

### Usage

In order to use it, one simply needs to compile & run `Program.cs` file or a [pre-built version](https://github.com/bored-user/MatrixMath/tree/master/releases).<br>
There's a CLI wizard which will guide the user.

### Building

The project can be built using a tool like [`csc`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-options/command-line-building-with-csc-exe) or [`mcs`](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/csharp/) (C# compilers). However, I've already added a [`releases`](https://github.com/bored-user/MatrixMath/tree/master/releases) folder which contains all releases in `matrixmath_v[version_here].exe` naming format.
